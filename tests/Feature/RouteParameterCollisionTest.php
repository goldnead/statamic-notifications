/**
 * Route parameter names are one namespace shared by the whole application.
 *
 * `Route::bind()` is registered on the router, not on the package that calls
 * it. From that moment every route with that parameter name, in every installed
 * addon, resolves through the binding package — and the route that loses does
 * not fail loudly. It hands a foreign id to a repository that has never heard
 * of it and answers 404.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. goldnead/statamic-leadhub 1.8.0 shipped
 * `/scoring/{rule}`; goldnead/statamic-webhook-manager bound `rule` to its own
 * rule repository. On the Hub, which has both, editing or deleting a scoring
 * rule did nothing at all, and said nothing at all, through a release — with a
 * green suite on both sides.
 *
 * ── The rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   An addon may only bind parameter names that unambiguously belong to it.
 *   A bound name must be specific enough that no sibling package would reach
 *   for it by accident. Names that are NOT bound may stay generic — they
 *   cannot collide, because nothing resolves them.
 *
 * Here the shape of "belongs to it" is the `notification` prefix plus a capital. This
 * addon binds nothing at all today, so the rule costs it nothing — which is
 * exactly why it is worth pinning now. The binding that hurts is never the one
 * somebody weighed; it is the one added later because binding by the entity's
 * obvious name looked like the obvious thing to do.
 *
 * ── Why this is checkable and the old snapshot list was not ───────────────
 *
 * The previous version of this file compared this addon's parameter names
 * against a hand-written list of names other installed packages bind. That
 * list can only describe the siblings as they are today: it says nothing about
 * the addon that starts binding `{handle}` next month, which is exactly the
 * case that hurts. It was also already wrong — it named `webhook`, `endpoint`,
 * `rule` and `template` as claimed by statamic-webhook-manager, and
 * `automation` as claimed by statamic-automations. Webhook-manager renamed its
 * four in 1.7.0 and automations renamed its one in 1.6.0; all five names are
 * free, and every entry naming them was describing a world that had moved on.
 *
 * The rule above needs no knowledge of the siblings at all. It is a property
 * of this package, so this package's own suite can enforce it.
 *
 * That is also what protects the generic names in this addon's route files.
 * `{id}`, this addon's only parameter, is unbound and staying unbound —
 * renaming them would move text without removing any exposure. They are safe
 * as long as nobody binds them, and under the rule above nobody may: a package
 * that binds must bind a name of its own, and `handle` is nobody's own.
 *
 * ── What this file still cannot do ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A collision only exists once two packages are installed together, and a
 * package cannot see its siblings from inside its own suite. The last test
 * below adds the reverse direction for packages that do NOT follow our rule —
 * statamic/cms binds `{entry}`, `{collection}` and friends, and always will.
 * That list is short, third-party and stable; it is not a stand-in for knowing
 * what the siblings do.
 */

/**
 * Every route parameter this addon declares, read from the route files rather
 * than the router, so the check covers routes regardless of how the test bed
 * happens to mount them.
 *
 * Only string literals are scanned. Route files carry example URLs in their
 * comments, and a plain regex over the file text reports those as parameters.
 *
 * @return array<string, list<string>> parameter name => route files using it
